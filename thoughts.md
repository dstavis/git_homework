Organization is my best friend
Interacting with my fellow students is an incredible resource

Maia C. had a great conversation with me after class yesterday that helped me feel more secure about the Turing journey, and Danielle has been super helpful too!

Brenna S. has also been really generous, offering to help with any tricky issues I encounter.

Bless this cohort!
